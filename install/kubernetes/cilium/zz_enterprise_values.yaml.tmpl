  # featureGates is a list of feature IDs that are allowed to be enabled.
  # Enabling a feature without adding it to this list will cause the agent or
  # operator to fail to start.
  # Note: This list is not used to enable features, but to allow features to be
  # enabled via their respective configuration options.
  #
  # To allow all Alpha, Beta and Limited features you can pass AllowAlphaFeatures,
  # AllowBetaFeatures and AllowLimitedFeatures respectively.
  #
  # Example usage: featureGates: [AllBetaFeatures, DatapathModeIPDualStack]
  # would allow all beta features and the DatapathModeIPDualStack feature.
